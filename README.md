## Introduction

This assignment explores various Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods, including classification, regression, and object detection. Each case is implemented with a tailored approach to achieve optimal model performance, with the aim of meeting accuracy standards for each task.

## Cases

### Case 01: Classification
This case involves developing a multiclass classification model to categorize data based on available features. The model is optimized to minimize classification error.

**Case Details:**
- Type: Multiclass Classification
- Framework: TensorFlow-Keras
- Goal: Achieve optimal accuracy in multiclass classification

### Case 02: Binary Classification
The second case focuses on binary classification, where the model predicts one of two possible classes. This approach is widely used in applications like spam detection and image classification.

**Case Details:**
- Type: Binary Classification
- Framework: TensorFlow-Keras
- Goal: Achieve optimal accuracy in binary prediction

### Case 03: Deep Learning Regression
In the third case, a deep learning model is used for continuous value prediction, specifically for predicting house prices in California based on the provided dataset. The regression model is designed to minimize prediction error.

**Case Details:**
- Type: Regression
- Framework: TensorFlow-Keras
- Goal: Predict house prices with optimal accuracy
- Dataset: California Housing Prices

### Case 04: Object Detection
The final case involves developing an object detection model to identify and locate specific objects in images.

**Case Details:**
- Type: Object Detection
- Framework: TensorFlow-Keras
- Goal: Detect and determine object positions in images
